## 1. Introduction: 

starts with [[SolarWinds hack]]

Brief intro to Zeek (formerly Bro): An open-source, passive network security monitoring (NSM) tool that analyzes traffic without disrupting it—perfect for detecting threats in real-time.

Why now? Highlight current trends: Rising cyberattacks (e.g., 2024 stats on ransomware surges), IT/OT convergence, and Zeek's role in tools like [[Elastic Security]].

Fun fact: Zeek powers security at major orgs like Google and NSA—share a quick story of how it [[detected a zero-day exploit]].

Use a **short video** clip or meme (e.g., "Zeek watching your network like a hawk").

## 2. Basics: Understanding Zeek's Foundations 

**Key Topics**:

- What Zeek does: Passively captures traffic, parses protocols (HTTP, DNS, Modbus), and generates logs (e.g., conn.log for connections, http.log for web activity).
- Core components: Scripts (Zeek's language for custom logic), analyzers (for protocol dissection), and logs (TSV/JSON outputs).
- Simple use case: Monitoring a home network for unusual DNS queries signaling malware.

**Engagement Tactics**:

- Visual demo: Show a basic Zeek setup on a slide with screenshots—run a quick live command like zeek -r sample.pcap to generate logs.
- Analogy: "Imagine Zeek as a librarian cataloging every book (packet) in your network library."
- Audience interaction: Ask, "What's the first thing you'd monitor in your network?" to spark discussion.

## 3. Technical Dive: Implementation and Advanced Features

**Engagement Tactics**:
- Live Demo: Replay a PCAP file showing Zeek detecting a phishing attempt—walk through logs in real-time.

Transition: "Zeek's powerful, but no tool is perfect—let's explore the challenges."

## 4. Challenges and Security Issues: Real-World Hurdles 
[[Challenges and Security Issues]]

- Performance Challenges: High traffic volumes cause packet drops—solutions: Optimize with PF_RING, cluster scaling, or focused analyzers.

- Security Issues: Zeek's own vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated plugins exposing sensors)—mitigate with regular updates and air-gapped deployments in OT.

- Evasion Techniques: Attackers obfuscating traffic (e.g., encrypted payloads)—counter with protocol-agnostic scripts and integration with decryption tools.

- OT-Specific Challenges: Latency sensitivity in ICS; issues like proprietary protocols—solutions: Custom analyzers and passive monitoring.

- Broader Trends: 2025 threats like AI-driven attacks bypassing signatures—Zeek's role in behavioral detection.
