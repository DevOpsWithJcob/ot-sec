# The SolarWinds Hack: A Comprehensive Overview

The SolarWinds hack, uncovered in December 2020, is one of the most significant cyber supply chain attacks to date, impacting government agencies, private corporations, and critical infrastructure worldwide. This explanation covers the attack’s background, execution, impact, and how a tool like Zeek could have aided detection, tailored for clarity and relevance to OT/ICS cybersecurity professionals.

## 1. Background of the SolarWinds Hack
- **What Happened**: Attackers, widely attributed to Russia’s SVR (state-sponsored group APT29 or Cozy Bear), compromised SolarWinds’ Orion software, a widely used IT monitoring platform. They inserted malicious code into legitimate software updates, which were then distributed to thousands of organizations.
- **Timeline**: The attack began as early as September 2019, with the malicious updates (versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1) released between March and June 2020. It was discovered in December 2020 by FireEye, a cybersecurity firm.
- **Scope**: Over 18,000 organizations downloaded the compromised updates, including U.S. government agencies (e.g., Departments of State, Treasury, Homeland Security), tech giants (e.g., Microsoft, Cisco), and critical infrastructure entities.

## 2. How the Attack Was Executed
The SolarWinds hack was a sophisticated supply chain attack leveraging trusted software distribution channels. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial Compromise**:
   - Attackers gained access to SolarWinds’ build environment, likely through a phishing or credential stuffing attack, exploiting weak supply chain security.
   - They targeted the Orion Platform, used for network and system monitoring, which had broad access to enterprise networks.

2. **Malware Insertion**:
   - The attackers injected a malicious DLL (Dynamic Link Library) named `SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll` into Orion’s update process.
   - The malware, dubbed **Sunburst**, was embedded in signed, legitimate software updates, making it nearly undetectable by traditional antivirus tools.

3. **Malicious Behavior**:
   - **Stealth Period**: After installation, Sunburst remained dormant for up to two weeks to evade detection.
   - **Command-and-Control (C2)**: It communicated with attacker-controlled domains using DNS queries (via CNAME records) to blend with normal traffic. For example, it used domains like `avsvmcloud.com` for C2.
   - **Payload Delivery**: Sunburst delivered secondary payloads (e.g., **Teardrop**, a memory-only dropper) to select high-value targets, enabling further exploitation like Cobalt Strike beacons for persistence and data theft.

4. **Exploitation Tactics**:
   - **Privilege Escalation**: Exploited SAML token vulnerabilities (Golden SAML attack) to forge authentication for cloud services like Microsoft 365.
   - **Lateral Movement**: Used stolen credentials and network access to move across systems, exfiltrating sensitive data (e.g., emails, source code).
   - **Obfuscation**: Employed advanced techniques like encoding C2 traffic in DNS and mimicking legitimate Orion processes.

## 3. Impact of the Attack
The SolarWinds hack had far-reaching consequences, particularly for critical infrastructure and government entities:

- **Affected Organizations**: Up to 18,000 entities downloaded the malicious update, though only a subset (e.g., 100-200 high-value targets) were actively exploited.
- **Government Impact**: U.S. agencies like the Department of Defense, Justice, and Energy faced data breaches, compromising national security data.
- **Private Sector**: Companies like Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco reported breaches, with source code and intellectual property at risk.
- **OT/ICS Relevance**: While primarily an IT attack, the hack raised concerns for OT environments due to Orion’s use in monitoring ICS networks (e.g., energy grids). Compromised IT systems could serve as entry points for OT attacks, as seen in incidents like Triton.
- **Economic and Trust Costs**: Mitigation costs reached billions, with long-term damage to trust in software supply chains.

## 4. How Zeek Could Have Helped Detect the Attack
Zeek, as a network security monitoring (NSM) tool, excels at analyzing traffic for anomalies, making it a valuable asset for detecting attacks like SolarWinds. Here’s how Zeek could have been utilized:

1. **DNS Log Analysis**:
   - **What Zeek Does**: Zeek’s `dns.log` captures DNS queries and responses, including CNAME records used by Sunburst for C2.
   - **Detection Opportunity**: Unusual DNS patterns, such as high-frequency queries to domains like `avsvmcloud.com` or NXDOMAIN responses, could trigger alerts. For example, a Zeek script like:
     ```zeek:disable-run
     event dns_request(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, query: string) {
       if (query contains "avsvmcloud.com")
         NOTICE([$note=SuspiciousDNS, $msg="Potential C2 detected", $conn=c]);
     }
     ```
     could flag malicious domains.
   - **OT Relevance**: In IT/OT converged networks, DNS anomalies often precede OT attacks (e.g., malware staging).

2. **Connection Monitoring**:
   - **What Zeek Does**: `conn.log` tracks all TCP/UDP connections, including source/destination IPs, ports, and byte counts.
   - **Detection Opportunity**: Sunburst’s C2 traffic used non-standard ports and low-volume data transfers. Zeek could detect this via scripts monitoring `conn.log` for connections to known bad IPs or unusual durations:
     ```zeek
     const suspicious_domains: set[string] = {"avsvmcloud.com"} &redef;
     event connection_established(c: connection) {
       if (c$id$resp_h in suspicious_domains)
         NOTICE([$note=C2Connection, $msg="Suspicious connection", $conn=c]);
     }
     ```

3. **HTTP and File Activity**:
   - **What Zeek Does**: `http.log` and `files.log` track HTTP sessions and file transfers, respectively.
   - **Detection Opportunity**: Sunburst used HTTP for secondary payload delivery. Zeek could flag unusual User-Agents or file downloads from unknown servers, common in OT environments with SCADA web interfaces.

4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - **What Zeek Does**: `weird.log` captures unexpected network behavior (e.g., malformed packets).
   - **Detection Opportunity**: Sunburst’s obfuscated C2 traffic could appear as anomalies in `weird.log`. Custom scripts could alert on unexpected protocol usage in OT networks (e.g., HTTP where only Modbus is expected).

5. **Integration with ELK**:
   - Zeek logs, when indexed in Elasticsearch via Logstash, enable real-time visualization in Kibana. A dashboard showing spikes in DNS queries to suspicious domains or unusual connection patterns could have accelerated detection.

## 5. Challenges in Detection
- **Stealth**: Sunburst’s dormancy and use of legitimate software updates evaded traditional signature-based tools.
- **DNS Obfuscation**: C2 traffic blended with normal DNS, requiring behavioral analysis.
- **Supply Chain Complexity**: Compromised updates from trusted vendors bypassed trust assumptions.
- **OT Implications**: In OT environments, detecting IT-based attacks like SolarWinds is harder due to air-gapped systems or limited monitoring.

---

## 6. Lessons Learned and Mitigation Strategies
- **Patch Management**: Regularly update software and verify supply chain integrity (e.g., code signing checks).
- **Network Monitoring**: Deploy NSM tools like Zeek to baseline traffic and detect anomalies.
- **Segmentation**: Isolate IT and OT networks; use DMZs to limit lateral movement.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integrate Zeek with feeds (e.g., MISP) to block known malicious domains/IPs.
- **Zero Trust**: Implement least-privilege access, especially for monitoring tools like Orion.
- **OT-Specific Actions**: In ICS environments, monitor for IT-to-OT pivoting (e.g., via `modbus.log` for unusual commands post-breach).

---

## 7. Zeek Configuration for Similar Attacks
To detect SolarWinds-like attacks:
- **Enable JSON Logging**: `redef LogAscii::use_json = T;` in `local.zeek` for ELK integration.
- **Script for DNS Anomalies**: Monitor `dns.log` for suspicious domains or high query rates.
- **Threshold Alerts**: Set rules in Zeek scripts (e.g., `const max_dns_queries = 100 &redef;`) to flag potential C2.
- **Logstash Pipeline**: Parse `dns.log` and `conn.log` in ELK, creating Kibana alerts for unusual patterns.
- **OT Focus**: Load ICS analyzers (`@load protocols/modbus`) to detect follow-on OT attacks.

## 8. Conclusion
The SolarWinds hack exposed the fragility of software supply chains, impacting IT and potentially OT environments. Its stealthy execution via trusted updates and sophisticated C2 mechanisms made it a landmark incident. Zeek’s passive monitoring, detailed logging (e.g., `dns.log`, `conn.log`), and scripting capabilities could have detected anomalies like suspicious DNS or connections, especially when integrated with ELK for real-time analysis. By adopting Zeek and robust security practices, organizations can better defend against similar attacks, particularly in critical OT/ICS settings.
